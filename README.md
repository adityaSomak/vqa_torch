## VQA PSL AAAI 2018, Aditya, Yang, Baral 

This repo contains necessary helper codes to reproduce the results in [Explicit Reasoning over End-to-End Neural Architectures for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08896) which was presented
  in AAAI 2018. 
- Data creation: `matlab_codes/train.m` (for relation prediction matrices), `relationsdata/code/datapreparation.py` (for training data preparation)
- Running, either use `vqa_engine/main.py` (check README) or one can also use the [PSLQA code-base](https://github.com/adityaSomak/PSLQA) for this.
